      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <li>
        How would I make a class for just the h1 or h2? If I wanted to just style one of those using class? Wouldn't make sense to put a div w/class inside a div with class? Or do people just not do that and just css the h1 , h2 etc on own as elements always.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assignment asks to repeat background image to fill whole page but mine already did by default? Not sure if you were looking for something else. But I added the background repeat for filling whole page for good measure anyway.
